title: "Funnels"
---

Funnels represent an event or sequence of events taken by a model. These events are represented by steps. These steps can trigger actions.

For example, an app might have an onboarding funnel with 3 steps; `sign_up`, `development_api_call`, and `production_api_call`. On `sign_up`,
you might want to be notified in a slack channel of the `sign_up` and reminded via email 3 days later if a customer doesn't get to `development_api_call`. While for
`production_api_call` you might want to send the customer a personalized email or slack message congratulating them for completing integration. You can define all
this behavior in funnels.

### Parameters

<ParamField body="id" type="string" required>
  Human-readable identifier for the Funnel.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="forModels" type="string[] | string" required>
  The list of model names or name that should are applicable for this funnel.
  For example, maybe your onboarding funnel is only applicable to a customer,
  not an organization.
</ParamField>
### Steps
<ParamField body="steps" type="step[] | step" required>
  Steps are the sequential events that happen during a funnel. They will 
  have actions that will fire when the event is fired and the steps is satified.
  Events get called when the developer calls `/api/v1/events` with an event name 
  that equals the event name in the step object. See [events endpoint](/events)
  for more information.

<Warning>
  If there are multiple events in a `steps` array, the event can only be
  satified if every event before it have been satified and the single event
  after it has NOT been satified.
</Warning>
