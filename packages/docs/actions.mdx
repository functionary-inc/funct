title: "Actions"

Actions are how you define activities that happens after a [step](/funnels#steps) is satified. Actions are not a
top-level key like `models` or `funnels`. Instead they live inside steps, which live inside funnels (see example at bottom
in [funnels](/funnels)).

### Parameters

<ParamField body="type" type="string" required>
  This is the type of the action. For example, `slack`, `email`, `sms`, or
  `webhook`. See the [Action Types]() section for more details
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="args" type="object" required>
  Detailed parameters for the action. These can use
  [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating for each recursive
  value in the args object. See the [Action Types](). For detailed examples of
  the shape of the args parameter.
</ParamField>

### Templating Args

you can use [liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to template the string values in the `action.args` object.

For example, let's say you want to send a congrats text to a customer after they complete onboarding. The action
might look like

```json
{
  "type": "sms",
  "args": {
    "number": "{{modelProperties.number}}",
    "content": "Congrats {{displayName}}!"
  }
}
```

when the step is statisfied the action would turn into something like

```json
{
  "type": "sms",
  "args": { "number": "+14248349987", "content": "Congrats Justin!" }
}
```

which would eventually turn into send a sms to `14248349987` saying `Congrats Justin!`.  
These action objects have access to these parameters.
