## Basics

There are 2 main API endpoints for functionary. The first is `/api/v1/identify`.
The second is `/api/v1/events`.

<ParamField body="name" type="string" required>
  name of the event.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ids" type="(string | number)[]" required>
  id or ids of the model your are calling the event on. If the model doesn't
  exist, the event will be thrown out.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="properties" type="object">
  Properties you want stored on the event you are creating.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string">
  The type of the model to assign the event. This is for to avoiding `id`
  collisions accross model types. For example, you may send `ids = [1]`, but it
  is possible that a model where `id=1` exists for both model types of
  "organization" and "customer". If `model="customer"` exists functionary knows
  to assign event to the "customer" model not the organization. If it doesn't
  exist, functionary will assign the relationship to the first model it finds
  with a matching id.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  header="Authorization"
  placeholder="Bearer this-is-token"
  type="object"
>
  Your api key found in the dashboard under settings
</ParamField>
