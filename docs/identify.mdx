title: "Identify"
description: "Create or Update a model"
api: "POST api/v1/identify"
---

## Basics

There are 2 main API endpoints for functionary. The first is `/api/v1/identify`.
The second is `/api/v1/events`.

## How it works

`identify` is how you create different instances of models you've defined in your config.

Before you can send any events for an object, you need to create it by calling identify.

This endpoint is meant to be fired the multiple time, not just the first time an app learns
about an model instance. To update a model instance, you also call identify. For example,
you might call `identify` to create a user. The user has a property `task_created`. To updated
`task_created`, you'll call `identify` with the new value for `task_created`. `identify` is last write
wins, so update the model as it makes sense.

## Parameters

<ParamField body="displayName" type="string">
  Human-readable name of an instance of a model that is identified
</ParamField>

<Info>This model must exist in you config file. see [Models](/models)</Info>
<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
  Model type of the object you are trying to identify.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="ids" type="(string | number)[]" required>
  id or ids of the object your are trying to create. see below for explination.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="childIds" type="(string | number)[]">
  The ids of the child objects for this model instance. If ids representing
  multiple different child objects are sent, the identified model instance will
  be set to the parent for *ALL* the different objects. If the childId doesn't
  yet exist, the id will be saved and paired when the child model instance is
  created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="childModel" type="string">
  The type of the model being assigned as the child. This is for to avoiding
  `id` collisions accross model types. For example, you may send `childIds =
  [1]`, but it is possible that a model where `id=1` exists for both model types
  of "organization" and "customer". If `childModel="customer"` exists
  functionary knows to only assign the relationship of "child" to "customer"
  model not the organization. If it doesn't exist, functionary will assign the
  relationship to the first model it finds with a matching id.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="parentIds" type="(string | number)[]">
  The ids of the parent object for this model instance. If ids representing
  multiple different parent objects are sent, the identified model instance will
  be set to a child for ALL the different objects. If the parentId doesn't yet
  exist, the id will be saved and paired when the parent model instance is
  created.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="parentModel" type="string">
  The type of the model being assigned as the parent. This is for to avoiding
  `id` collisions accross model types. For example, you may send `parentIds =
  [1]`, but it is possible that a model where `id=1` exists for both model types
  of "organization" and "customer". If `parentModel="customer"` exists
  functionary knows to only assign the relationship of "parent" to "customer"
  model not the organization. If it doesn't exist, functionary will assign the
  relationship to the first model it finds with a matching id.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="properties" type="object">
  Properties you want stored on the model instance you are creating.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
  header="Authorization"
  placeholder="Bearer this-is-token"
  type="object"
>
  Your api key found in the dashboard under settings
</ParamField>

## Aliases and Ids

A model instances can have **MANY** different ids and are easily updated.
To add more ids to model, just send them along with already identified ids.

If there are no existing ids in the ids payload for existing model instances,
functionary will create a new model instance.

If an id in the payload already belongs to a model instance, the payload are
will be treated as an update for that model.

Properties and displayName will be overwritten with new values. Additional
ids will be added to that model.

Ids are unique within the same model type. This means you can have an `id = 837` for
a customer model instance and an `id = 837` for a organization model instance, but you
can't have 2 customer model instances with `id = 837`.

<Note>
  If two different typed models exist with the same id (noted above), you'll
  need to use the optional `childModel` or the `parentModel` parameters in the
  `/identify` request body to assign relationships. This avoids a relationship
  being assigned to the wrong model.
</Note>

For example, if I `/identify` a "customer" model with `ids = [1]`, assuming there is no customer yet
created with that id, a model will be created. Now if I `/identify` a "customer" model with
`ids = [1, some@email.com]`, a new model will **NOT** be created, instead the original model with
`ids = [1]` will be updated.

After those 2 calls, let's say I call `/identify` (or `/event`) with
only `ids = [some@email.com]`, we will be referrencing the same model where `ids = [1]`.

<Tip>
  If you think you need a model to share an id, you may want to consider a
  parent model instead.
