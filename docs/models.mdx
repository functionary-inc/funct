title: "Models"
---

A Model is the core representation of an object/noun in Functionary. What a model is can be
different for every company, but usually, it's is a customer and/or an organization.
That said, you can name identifiable objects however you like.

These models are declared in the configuration file under the `models` key. They are created by
calling the `/api/v1/identify` endpoint.

<Info>
  There is a special `onFunctionaryIdentify` event that is fired when you
  identify an model. If you need to take action on when identifying a model,
  create a step in a funnel with the event name on `onFunctionaryIdentify`.
